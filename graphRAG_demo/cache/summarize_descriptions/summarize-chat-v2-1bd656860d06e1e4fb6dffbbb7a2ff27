Their engagement comes to an end as Belle recognizes Scrooge's priorities shifting away from their relationship and towards his greed for money. This pivotal moment in Scrooge's life is highlighted during the visit of the Ghost of Christmas Past, serving as a poignant reminder of what Scrooge has sacrificed in his pursuit of wealth.
