{"result": "Marley, known as Jacob Marley, is a deceased individual who plays a significant role in the story of 'A Christmas Carol'. He was Scrooge's business partner, and his presence and memory have a profound impact on Scrooge. Marley's influence is evident through various supernatural occurrences, including the visual hallucination of Marley's face on tiles and a door knocker, symbolizing Scrooge's haunted past and marking the beginning of his supernatural journey. These manifestations of Marley serve as a harbinger of the impending visitations that Scrooge is warned about.
